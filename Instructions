                                                     ---  Instructions ---


  Hardware of the PC:
    CPU - 
      Register -
        Description: Units of memory built in CPU 
        Size in bits: 32 (4 bytes) 
        Number of units: 32 
        Range: 0 - 31 
        Code name: $ . Ex: Register number 1 = $1
        Byte Order: Little Endian (reg 31 most Significant) 
    
    RAM - 
      Description: Memory slot on the motherboard 
      Size in bit: 8 bits (1 byte)
      Number of units: 2^25 
      range: 0 - (2^25) - 1
      
   Support:
   Integer: possitive, negetive (int)
   Method for negetive integer: 2's complements
   Character: ASCII
   
   Not Support:
   Real number (double): Ex: 1.5, 2.3
   
   Machine Operation -
    Description: actions between bits . Ex: 5 + 3 = 8
    - Operation consist:
    1. Operator 
    2. Operand
    
    -- We need to coding the Machine Operation --
    Coding to 32bit (4 byte)
